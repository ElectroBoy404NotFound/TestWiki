This page presents a dissection of the current stable [http://minecraft.net/game/ Minecraft] protocol. The current pre-release protocol is documented [[Pre-release_protocol|elsewhere]]. The protocol for Pocket Minecraft is substantially different, and is documented at [[Pocket Minecraft Protocol]].

If you're having trouble, check out the [[Protocol_FAQ|FAQ]] or ask for help in the IRC channel ([irc://irc.freenode.net/mcdevs #mcdevs on irc.freenode.net]).

== Packets ==
All packets begin with a single "Packet ID" byte.  Listed packet size includes this byte.  Packets are either "server to client", "client to server", or "Two-Way" (both). Packets are not prefixed with their length. For variable length packets, you must parse it completely to determine its length.

{{anchor|0x00}}
=== Keep Alive (0x00) ===
''Two-Way''

The server will frequently send out a keep-alive, each containing a random ID. The client must respond with the same packet.
The Beta server will disconnect a client if it doesn't receive at least one packet before 1200 in-game ticks, and the Beta client will time out the connection under the same conditions. The client may send packets with Keep-alive ID=0.

=== Chat Message (0x03) ===
''Two-Way''

The default server will check the message to see if it begins with a '/'. If it doesn't, the username of the sender is prepended and sent to all other clients (including the original sender). If it does, the server assumes it to be a command and attempts to process it. A message longer than 100 characters will cause the server to kick the client. (As of 1.3.2, the vanilla client appears to limit the text a user can enter to 100 charaters.) This limits the chat message packet length to 203 bytes (as characters are encoded on 2 bytes). Note that this limit does not apply to chat messages sent by the server, which are limited to 32767 characters since 1.2.5. This change was initially done by allowing the client to not slice the message up to 119 (the previous limit), without changes to the server. For this reason, the vanilla server kept the code to cut messages at 119, but this isn't a protocol limitation and can be ignored.

=== Time Update (0x04) ===
''Server to Client''

Time is based on ticks, where 20 ticks happen every second. There are 24000 ticks in a day, making Minecraft days exactly 20 minutes long.

The time of day is based on the timestamp modulo 24000. 0 is sunrise, 6000 is noon, 12000 is sunset, and 18000 is midnight.

The default SMP server increments the time by <code>20</code> every second.

Sent by the server to update/set the health of the player it is sent to. Added in protocol version 5.

Food saturation acts as a food "overcharge". Food values will not decrease while the saturation is over zero. Players logging in automatically get a saturation of 5.0. Eating food increases the saturation as well as the food bar.

* Please avoid changing player's dimension to same dimension as he was in (i.e. from Nether to Nether, from Overworld to Overworld). While at first glance everything seems to work, weird bugs can occur, i.e. such player will be unable to attack other players in new world (minecraft client just won't send "Use Entity (0x07)" packet on hitting, only "Animation (0x12)" packet), even though he can see them and they can attack him (fixes after his death and respawn though).
If you actually have multiple worlds of same dimension on server and need to teleport player between them, use intermediate world (with different dimension) between them.

{{anchor|0x0A}}
=== Player (0x0A) ===
''Client to Server''

This packet is used to indicate whether the player is on ground (walking/swimming), or airborne (jumping/falling).

When dropping from sufficient height, fall damage is applied when this state goes from False to True. The amount of damage applied is based on the point where it last changed from True to False. Note that there are several movement related packets containing this state.

This packet was previously referred to as Flying

Updates the players XYZ position on the server. 
If <code>Stance - Y</code> is less than <code>0.1</code> or greater than <code>1.65</code>, the stance is illegal and the client will be kicked with the message “Illegal Stance”.
If the distance between the last known position of the player on the server and the new position set by this packet is greater than 100 units will result in the client being kicked for "You moved too quickly :( (Hacking?)"
Also if the absolute number of X or Z is set greater than <code>3.2E7D</code> the client will be kicked for "Illegal position"

=== Player Look (0x0C) ===
''Client to Server''

[[File:Minecraft-trig-yaw.png|thumb|The unit circle for yaw]]

Updates the direction the player is looking in.

Yaw is measured in degrees, and does not follow classical trigonometry rules. The unit circle of yaw on the xz-plane starts at (0, 1) and turns backwards towards (-1, 0), or in other words, it turns clockwise instead of counterclockwise. Additionally, yaw is not clamped to between 0 and 360 degrees; any number is valid, including negative numbers and numbers greater than 360.

Pitch is measured in degrees, where 0 is looking straight ahead, -90 is looking straight up, and 90 is looking straight down.

You can get a unit vector from a given yaw/pitch via:
  x = -cos(pitch) * sin(yaw)
  y = -sin(pitch)
  z =  cos(pitch) * cos(yaw)

=== Player Digging (0x0E) ===

|-
| Started digging
| <code>0</code>
|-
| Cancelled digging
| <code>1</code>

| <code>2</code>
|-
| Drop item stack
| <code>3</code>
|-
| Drop item
| <code>4</code>
|-
| Shoot arrow / finish eating
| <code>5</code>
|}

Notchian clients send a 0 (started digging) when they start digging and a 2 (finished digging) once they think they are finished. If digging is aborted, the client simply send a 1 (Cancel digging).

Status code 4 (drop item) is a special case.  In-game, when you use the Drop Item command (keypress 'q'), a dig packet with a status of 4, and all other values set to 0, is sent from client to server. Status code 3 is similar, but drops the entire stack.

Status code 5 (shoot arrow / finish eating) is also a special case. The x, y and z fields are all set to 0 like above, with the exception of the face field, which is set to 255.

The face can be one of six values, representing the face being hit:

{| class="wikitable"

In normal operation (ie placing a block), this packet is sent once, with the values set normally.

This packet has a special case where X, Y, Z, and Direction are all -1. (Note that Y is unsigned so set to 255.) This special packet indicates that the currently held item for the player should have its state updated such as eating food, shooting bows, using buckets, etc.

In a Notchian Beta client, the block or item ID corresponds to whatever the client is currently holding, and the client sends one of these packets any time a right-click is issued on a surface, so no assumptions can be made about the safety of the ID.  However, with the implementation of server-side inventory, a Notchian server seems to ignore the item ID, instead operating on server-side inventory information and holding selection. The client has been observed (1.2.5 and 1.3.2) to send both real item IDs and -1 in a single session.

Special note on using buckets:  When using buckets, the Notchian client might send two packets:  first a normal and then a special case.  The first normal packet is sent when you're looking at a block (e.g. the water you want to scoop up).  This normal packet does not appear to do anything with a Notchian server.  The second, special case packet appears to perform the action - based on current position/orientation and with a distance check - it appears that buckets can only be used within a radius of 6 units.

=== Spawn Named Entity (0x14) ===
''Server to Client''

The only named entities (at the moment) are players (either real or NPC/Bot). This packet is sent by the server when a player comes into visible range, '''not''' when a player joins.

Servers can, however, safely spawn player entities for players not in visible range. The client appears to handle it correctly.

At one point, the Notchian client was not okay with receiving player entity packets, including 0x14, that refer to its own username or EID; and would teleport to the absolute origin of the map and fall through the Void any time it received them. However, in more recent versions, it appears to handle them correctly, by spawning a new entity as directed (though future packets referring to the entity ID may be handled incorrectly).

=== Collect Item (0x16) ===
''Server to Client''

Sent by the server when someone picks up an item lying on the ground - its sole purpose appears to be the animation of the item flying towards you. It doesn't destroy the entity in the client memory ([[#0x1D|0x1D]] does that), and it doesn't add it to your inventory ([[#0x67|0x67]] does that). The server only checks for items to be picked up after each [[#0x0B|Player Position]] and [[#0x0D|Player Position & Look]] packet sent by the client.

=== Entity (0x1E) ===
''Server to Client''

Most entity-related packets are subclasses of this packet. When sent from the server to the client, it may initialize the entry.

For player entities, either this packet or any move/look packet is sent every game tick.
So the meaning of this packet is basically that the entity did not move/look since the last such packet.

=== Entity Relative Move (0x1F) ===
''Server to Client''

This packet is sent by the server when an entity moves less then 4 blocks; if an entity moves more than 4 blocks [[#0x22|Entity Teleport]] should be sent instead.

This packet allows at most four blocks movement in any direction, because byte range is from -128 to 127. Movement is an offset of Absolute Int; to convert relative move to block coordinate offset, divide by 32.

When right-clicking on a stack of items, half the stack will be picked up and half left in the slot.  If the stack is an odd number, the half left in the slot will be smaller of the amounts.

The Action number is actually a counter, starting at 1.  This number is used by the server as a transaction ID to send back a [[#0x6A|Transaction packet]].

The distinct type of click performed by the client is determined by the combination of the "Mode" and "Button" fields.

Starting from version 1.5, "painting mode" is available for use in inventory windows. It is done by picking up stack of something (more than 1 items), then holding mouse button (left, right or middle) and dragging holded stack over empty (or same type in case of right button ) slots. In that case client sends the following to server after mouse button release (omitting first pickup packet which is sent as usual):

# packet with mode 5, slot -999 , button (0 for left | 4 for right);
# packet for every slot painted on, mode is still 5, button (1 | 5);
# packet with mode 5, slot -999, button (2 | 6);

If any of the painting packets other than the "progress" ones are sent out of order (for example, a start, some slots, then another start; or a left-click in the middle) the painting status will be reset.

=== Player Abilities (0xCA) ===
''Two-Way''

The latter 2 bytes are used to indicate the walking and flying speeds respectively, while the first byte is used to determine the value of 4 booleans.
 
These booleans are whether damage is disabled (god mode, '8' bit), whether the player can fly ('4' bit), whether the player is flying ('2' bit), and whether the player is in creative mode ('1' bit).
 
To get the values of these booleans, simply AND (&) the byte with 1,2,4 and 8 respectively, to get the 0 or 1 bitwise value. To set them OR (|) them with their repspective masks.
The vanilla client sends this packet when the player starts/stops flying with the second parameter changed accordingly. All other parameters are ignored by the vanilla server.

=== Encryption Key Response (0xFC) ===
''Two-Way''

See [[Protocol Encryption]] for information on this packet. Bypassing the encryption is possible, authentication for the player name is still needed if the server is in online mode, but instead of sending this packet, you send [[#0xCD|Client Statuses]] instead.

=== Disconnect/Kick (0xFF) ===
''Two-Way''

Sent by the server before it disconnects a client, or by the client before it disconnects from the server. The receiver of this packet assumes that the sender has already closed the connection by the time the packet arrives.

Due to race conditions in the client, a local server may need to pause for a short period after sending this packet before closing the connection. An alternative is simply not to close the connection, and wait for the client to do so on receipt of this packet.
